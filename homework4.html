                    <br><em>Not My Respon­si­bility</em> is a 2020 American short film written and produced by singer-songwriter Billie Eilish.
                     A commentary on body shaming and double standards placed upon young women's appearances, it features a 
                     monologue from Eilish about the media scrutiny surrounding her body. The film is spoken-word and stars Eilish
                      in a dark room, where she gradually undresses before submerging herself in black substance. The film premiered
                       during Eilish's Where Do We Go? World Tour on March 9, 2020, as a concert interlude, and was released online
                        on May 26, 2020. Critics gave positive reviews, praising the commentary and tone, which they considered 
                        empowering. The film's audio was later included as a song on Eilish's second studio album, Happier Than Ever 
                        (2021). Some music journalists described it as the album's thematic centerpiece; others questioned its 
                        appearance on the tracklist, feeling that it lost its emotional impact without the visuals.

                Laguna Miñiques is a lake in northern Chile. It lies at the foot of the volcano Cerro Miscanti, south of Laguna Miscanti, 
                from which it receives inflow by seepage. The two lakes are separated by a lava flow. Like Miscanti and the nearby Laguna Lejía,
                 Miñiques is a fault-bound lake and has brackish waters. A popular tourist destination, it is part of the Los Flamencos National
                  Reserve, and is home to wildlife including the cladocerans Alona pulchella and Daphnia, the copepod Boeckella poopoensis, 
                  and unidentified species of Cyclopoida. 
                This panoramic photograph of Laguna Miñiques was taken in February 2016.
